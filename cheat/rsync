# To copy files from remote to local, maintaining file properties and sym-links (-a), zipping for faster transfer (-z), verbose (-v).  
rsync -avz host:file1 :file1 /dest/
rsync -avz /source host:/dest

# Copy files using checksum (-c) rather than time to detect if the file has changed. (Useful for validating backups). 
rsync -avc /source/ /dest/

# Copy contents of /src/foo to destination:

# This command will create /dest/foo if it does not already exist
rsync -auv /src/foo /dest

# Explicitly copy /src/foo to /dest/foo
rsync -auv /src/foo/ /dest/foo

# Itemized changes:
# -i, --itemize-changes
#
# Requests a simple itemized list of the changes that are being made to each
# file, including attribute changes. This is exactly the same as specifying
# --out-format='%i %n%L'. If you repeat the option, unchanged files will also be
# output, but only if the receiving rsync is at least version 2.6.7 (you can use
# -vv with older versions of rsync, but that also turns on the output of other
# verbose messages).
#
# The "%i" escape has a cryptic output that is 11 letters long. The general
# format is like the string YXcstpoguax, where Y is replaced by the type of
# update being done, X is replaced by the file-type, and the other letters
# represent attributes that may be output if they are being modified.
#
# The update types that replace the Y are as follows:
#
#  - A < means that a file is being transferred to the remote host (sent).
#  - A > means that a file is being transferred to the local host (received).
#  - A c means that a local change/creation is occurring for the item (such as
#        the creation of a directory or the changing of a symlink, etc.).
#  - A h means that the item is a hard link to another item (requires
#        --hard-links).
#  - A . means that the item is not being updated (though it might have
#        attributes that are being modified).
#  - A * means that the rest of the itemized-output area contains a message
#        (e.g. "deleting").
#
# The file-types that replace the X are: f for a file, a d for a directory, an L
# for a symlink, a D for a device, and a S for a special file (e.g. named
# sockets and fifos).
#
# The other letters in the string above are the actual letters that will be
# output if the associated attribute for the item is being updated or a "." for
# no change. Three exceptions to this are: (1) a newly created item replaces
# each letter with a "+", (2) an identical item replaces the dots with spaces,
# and (3) an unknown attribute replaces each letter with a "?" (this can happen
# when talking to an older rsync).
#
# The attribute that is associated with each letter is as follows:
#
#  - A c means either that a regular file has a different checksum (requires
#        --checksum) or that a symlink, device, or special file has a changed
#        value.  Note that if you are sending files to an rsync prior to 3.0.1,
#        this change flag will be present only for checksum-differing regular
#        files.
#  - A s means the size of a regular file is different and will be updated by
#        the file transfer.
#  - A t means the modification time is different and is being updated to the
#        sender’s value (requires --times). An alternate value of T means that
#        the modification time will be set to the transfer time, which happens
#        when a file/symlink/device is updated without --times and when a
#        symlink is changed and the receiver can’t set its time. (Note: when
#        using an rsync 3.0.0 client, you might see the s flag combined with t
#        instead of the proper T flag for this time-setting failure.)
#  - A p means the permissions are different and are being updated to the
#        sender’s value (requires --perms).
#  - An o means the owner is different and is being updated to the sender’s
#        value (requires --owner and super-user privileges).
#  - A g means the group is different and is being updated to the sender’s
#        value (requires --group and the authority to set the group).
#  - The u slot is reserved for future use.
#  - The a means that the ACL information changed.
#  - The x means that the extended attribute information changed.
#
# One other output is possible: when deleting files, the "%i" will output the
# string "*deleting" for each item that is being removed (assuming that you are
# talking to a recent enough rsync that it logs deletions instead of outputting
# them as a verbose message).
